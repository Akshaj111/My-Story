Hello. 
I am going to tell you a story.
Once upon a time there lived a Mouse named Speedo, who was an inhabitant of Mouseland.
Everyday he would happily go to work in the MSC - the Mouse Spy Central.
This was an elusive place, which was top-secret to even citizens of Mouseland.
Only the employees knew about the mysteries concealed in this.
